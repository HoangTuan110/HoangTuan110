I am Tuan (he/him), and I am a 14 year old Vietnamese (8th grade) student who likes making CLI programs and sometimes games.
I specializes on CLI programs, Golang and Python.
I don't contribute much to projects, so a (somewhat) newborn at OSS.

I use Keyoxide[0] for proving online identity. Use the key below to prove that it's me.

# Fun fact
My name is `tsuki` because of one time that I played a game called `Tsuki Odyssey` made by HyperBeard. The game is like Animal Crossing or all the chill games out there or whatever they called them. In the game, you are a rabbit called `Tsuki` who got his house robbed and you have to start all over again. I really like the looks of Tsuki, so I decided to yank the name. But I'm not sure if yanking the sprite of Tsuki is allowed (or even possible).
